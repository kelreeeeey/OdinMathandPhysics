# OdinMathandPhysics
Math and Physics simple procedures inspired by python libraries like numpy, scipy, etc.

This repo i made as i'm going forward learning [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin). Things might get comlicated as time goes, but i'll do
my best to keep it as neat as possible.

You're very welcome to replicate/use/do whatever you want to do
with this repo. I encourage you to write yourown stuff as well
as we are all have the right to learn from anything.

## What's inside this thing?

### [Matrix Operation](./mathandphysics/matrixoperations.odin)

self-explanatory itself.

### [Trigonometries thinggy](./mathandphysics/trigonometries.odin)

related to angles, sin cos and their frens

more -> [md Docs](./md_docs/trigonometries.md)

### [utils](./mathandphysics/utils.odin)

things i don't know where to put yet.
